# Overview

An app running in the background that periodically captures photos and
uploads them to the web when there is an Internet connection.

# Bug Reporting

Please send any bug reports to cases@ericmoyer.fogbugz.com. A good
report will include:

* What you expected to happen

* What happened

* What to do to make it happen again

* What phone and version of Android you were using

See [How to report bugs
effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)
for more tips

I'm just a little guy writing something for myself, so I probably
won't be able to fix your bug. However, not letting me know about it
will ensure that it never gets fixed. I will put every bug report that
I don't fix in a file for others to fix. Note that this could take
significant time since I am very busy.

# Contributing code

If you want to contribute code, make a fork on github. Make your
proposed change (and test it). Finally make a pull request.

If it is an involved feature that I might not like, feel free to
submit an issue to cases@ericmoyer.fogbugz.com so we can discuss it
before you put effort into coding it up.

# Acknowledgements

Thank you to Florian Echtler who created the original
Background-Timelapse app that I modified to create this. He generously
provided his work under the Gnu Public License. Without his input,
creating this app would have been much more difficult.
