# Overview

An app running in the background that periodically captures photos and
uploads them to the web when there is an Internet connection.

Thank you to Florian Echtler who created the original
Background-Timelapse app that I modified to create this. He generously
provided his work under the Gnu Public License. Without his input,
creating this app would have been much more difficult.
